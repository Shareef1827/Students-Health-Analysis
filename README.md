# Students-Health-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing student health and mental well-being data to understand how factors such as academic pressure, sleep duration, dietary habits, financial stress, and lifestyle patterns influence depression levels among students.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student health and mental well-being data to understand how factors such as academic pressure, sleep duration, dietary habits, financial stress, and lifestyle patterns influence depression levels among students.

The analysis combines Python-based EDA, SQL-driven business queries, and Power BI dashboarding to deliver actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
Mental health issues among students are increasing globally.
This project aims to:
- Identify patterns related to student depression
- Understand the impact of sleep, stress, diet, and academic pressure
- Support data-driven decision-making for educators and institutions

## Dataset Information
- Total Records: 27,900+ students
### Key Features:
- Demographics: Age, Gender, City, Degree, Profession
- Lifestyle: Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Work/Study Hours
- Stress Indicators: Academic Pressure, Work Pressure, Financial Stress
- Mental Health: Depression, Suicidal Thoughts, Family Mental Health History

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SQL: MySQL (Joins, CASE statements, Aggregations, Subqueries)
- Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, Interactive dashboards
- Jupyter Notebook: EDA & data preprocessing

## Project Workflow
1) Data Understanding & Cleaning
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) SQL Business Analysis
4) Dashboard Design & Visualization
5) Insight Generation & Interpretation

## Key Insights
### Univariate Analysis
- Around 16K students were identified with depression
- Most students reported 5–7 hours of sleep
- A significant share followed unhealthy or moderate dietary habits
### Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Less than 5 hours of sleep is associated with higher depression levels
- Academic and work pressure show a positive correlation with depression
- Unhealthy dietary habits are linked to higher depression rates
- Certain degrees and professions experience higher academic stress
- City-wise and gender-wise differences exist in student health patterns

## SQL Business Questions Answered
1) How many students are diagnosed with depression?
2) What percentage of students experienced suicidal thoughts?
3) Which age group shows the highest depression rate?
4) Does academic pressure increase depression levels?
5) How do sleep duration and dietary habits affect mental health?
6) Which degree programs report higher academic pressure?

## Power BI Dashboard
The Students Health Analysis Dashboard includes:
- Total students & depression count KPIs
- Gender and degree-wise analysis
- Sleep duration & dietary habit impact
- Financial stress and academic pressure visuals
- Interactive filters for Gender and Degree

## Business Value
- This project helps:
- Identify risk factors affecting student mental health
- Support early intervention and wellness programs
- Enable data-driven policies in educational institutions
- Improve awareness around lifestyle and stress management

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, transforming raw student health data into meaningful insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
